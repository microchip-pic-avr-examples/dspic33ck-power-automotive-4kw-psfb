## Summary

Steps to operate

1. when the controller turns on, you will see adc readings on the ADC, and the state on pcs standby.
2. click on Start Charge. This will turn on the short circuit switch charging the output caps. state PRECHARGE
3. when the output caps are charged, that is the voltage difference between FP_VCAP and FB_VOUT pins is less then 80mv then the state changes to STANDBY
4. click on start power transfer, this will start switching. with 0Â° phase shift. State UP AND RUNNING
5. use the slider to change the phase shift.
6. clicking on stop power transfer stops the switching and also turns off the short circuit switch. Short circuit switch status can be seen in fault enable pin status. fault enable pin red = controller pin high
7. click on start sync and stop sync to start stop sync switches.
8. IMPORTANT: only click stop power transfer when phase shift is 0.
