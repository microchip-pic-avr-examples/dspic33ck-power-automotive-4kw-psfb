# dspic33ck-power-automotive-4kw-psfb, release v1.0.1

## Release Highlights

Initial commit of the firmware for the automotive 4 kW 800 V DC to 12 V DC phase-shifted full-bridge (PSFB) DC/DC converter.
The firmware demonstrates the operation of a PSFB DC/DC converter using tightly coupled, phase-locked average current mode control. The ocntrol implementation includes a DROOP controller allowing current balanced operation of mutliple DC/DC converters in parallel on the same output DC bus without further synchronization between the control stages.

This version fixes a broken link to the online-documentation GitHub IO page in the Readme file.
